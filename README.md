-   No other WSL instances running Frappe benches. Ensure all other WSL instances with benches are closed before running the installer.

## üöÄ Installation

Follow these steps to install Frappe and optionally ERPNext and HRMS on your WSL environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository

Open your WSL terminal and clone the repository:


`git clone https://github.com/kamikazce/Frappe-ErpNext-Autoinstall-WSL.git`

`cd Frappe-ErpNext-Autoinstall-WSL`

3. Make the Installer Executable

`chmod +x install.sh` 

4. Run the Installer Execute the installer script with root privileges:

`sudo ./install.sh` 

## üõ† Usage The installer will guide you through several prompts: 
1. Create a New User: You can choose to create a new system user or use the current one.
2. MariaDB Root Password: Set a password for the MariaDB root user.
3. Administrator Password: Set a password for the Frappe administrator account.
4. Site Name: Specify the name of the new Frappe site.
5. Install ERPNext: Choose whether to install the ERPNext application.
6. Install HRMS: Choose whether to install the HRMS application.
7. Starting the Bench After the installation is complete, switch to the specified user and start the bench:

`sudo su - your_username cd /var/bench/frappe-bench15_unique_id/ bench start` 
* Replace `your_username` with the username you selected during installation. * Replace `unique_id` with the unique identifier generated during installation (e.g., `frappe-bench15_a3b99f84`).

* Accessing Your Site Open your web browser and navigate to:

`http://localhost:8000` 
Log in using: 
* Username: `Administrator`
* Password: The administrator password you set during installation.

## * ‚ö† Important Notes * 
Close Other WSL Instances: Before running the installer, ensure that no other WSL instances with Frappe benches are running. Having multiple benches running simultaneously can cause conflicts and prevent `bench start` from working correctly. 
* MariaDB Service: The installer starts MariaDB manually due to WSL limitations. Ensure MariaDB is running when you need it.
* Permissions: If you encounter any permissions issues, verify that directories and files have the correct ownership (`mysql:mysql` for MariaDB data directories).

## * üêû Troubleshooting * 
* Bench Start Issues: If `bench start` fails, check that no other benches are running and that MariaDB is active. 
* MariaDB Connection Errors: Ensure MariaDB is running and accepting connections on `127.0.0.1`. The script configures MariaDB to listen on localhost.
* Port Conflicts: If port `8000` is already in use, you can specify a different port when starting the bench:

`bench start --port 8001`
